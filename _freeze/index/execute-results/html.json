The `tidyverse` is a veritable universe of tools though that no single workshop could hope to cover so **we are focusing here on an introductory approach that focuses primarily on some fundamentals to tidying data in R**. We are always happy to improve workshop content so please don't hesitate to [post an Issue](https://github.com/NCEAS/scicomp-workshop-tidyverse/issues) on our GitHub repository if you see clear areas for improvement!\n\n<img src = \"images/hex_tidyverse.png\" align = \"right\" width = \"17%\" />\n\nTo maximize the value of this workshop to you, **we recommend you take the following steps before the day of the workshop**. If anything is unclear, feel free to reach out to us; our contact information can be found in the \"[Content Creators](about.qmd)\" tab.\n\n## Programs to Install\n\n### R & RStudio\n\n**Install [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and its more convenient (in our opinion) user-interface: [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)**.\n\nIf you already have R, check that you have at least version 4.0.0 by running the following code:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nversion$version.string\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf your version starts with a 3 (e.g., the above code returns \"R version 3...\"), please update R to make sure all packages behave as expected.\n\n### R Packages\n\n**Install the `tidyverse` and `palmerpenguins` R packages** using the following code:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\", \"palmerpenguins\")\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Please run the above code even if you already have these packages** to update these packages and ensure that your code aligns with the examples and challenges introduced during the workshop.\n\n## Websites to Visit\n\n### Supplemental Material\n\nWhile not technically necessary to attend the workshop, if you'd like you can see the content that created the workshop website you are viewing by visiting our [GitHub repository here](https://github.com/NCEAS/scicomp-workshop-tidyverse).\n",
